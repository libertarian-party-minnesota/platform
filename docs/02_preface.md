**What does the Libertarian Party stand for?**

Positions taken by the Libertarian Party of Minnesota are based on the inviolate principle that your life is your own. This means that you may provide for and enjoy your life in any way you wish as long as you do not forcibly interfere with anyone else’s equal right to do the same.

Members of the Libertarian Party do not necessarily advocate or approve of any of the practices our policies would make legal. Our exclusion of moral approval and disapproval is deliberate. Individual rights must be recognized; the wisdom of any course of peaceful action is a matter for the acting individual(s) to decide. Personal responsibility is discouraged by government when people are denied the opportunity to exercise it. Libertarian policies will create a society in which people are free to make, and learn from, their own decisions.

Throughout history, governments have operated on the opposite principle: that the State may dispose of the lives of individuals and the fruits of their labor. Even within the United States, all non-libertarian political parties and organizations assume that government bodies and agencies may initiate force against you and seize what you have produced without your consent through taxation and regulation.

Your primary right is your right to your own life. In order for this to be realized, you must have the final say over how your life is to be lived. No other person or group of persons can justify forcibly interfering with your life.

From this basic right derives all others, such as:

- Your right to property; that is, what you produce or trade for.
- Your right to pursue happiness; that is, the reason you choose to live, what makes life worthwhile for you.

This means, for example, you have the right:

- to make arrangements with anyone else to exchange services and property, and to carry out those exchanges free from outside interference;
- to save your property for future enjoyment or trade;
- to be free from invasions of your privacy; and
- to defend yourself and your property; but only as long as you do not forcibly interfere with another person’s equal right to do the same.
