## 3.A. Individual Rights and Civil Order

No conflict exists between civil order and individual rights. Both concepts are based on the same fundamental principle: that no individual, group, or government may initiate force against any other individual, group, or government.

### 3.A.1. Property Rights
The most basic property one has is one’s own body and one’s own life. If one chooses to use one’s life to acquire honestly and peacefully other property by industry, gift or trade, such acquisition represents that part of one’s life. Therefore property rights are part of individual rights.

We hold that the owners of property have the full right to control, use, dispose of, or in any manner enjoy their property without interference, until and unless the exercise of their control infringes the valid rights of others. We specifically condemn current government efforts to regulate or ban the use of property in the name of aesthetic values, riskiness, moral standards, cost-benefit estimates, or the promotion or restriction of economic growth.

We demand an end to the taxation of privately owned real property, which actually makes the State the owner of all lands and forces individuals to rent their homes and places of business from the State.

Where property, including land, has been taken from its rightful owners by government or private action in violation of individual rights, we favor restitution to the rightful owners.

Freedom of privacy, speech, press, and religion are conditions of property rights.

### 3.A.2. Protection of Privacy
The individual’s privacy, property, and right to speak or not to speak should not be infringed by the government. The government should not use electronic or other means of covert surveillance of an individual’s actions or private property except in the case of known criminal activity. Correspondence, bank and other financial transactions and records, doctors’ and lawyers’ communications, employment records, and the like should not be open to review by government without the consent of all parties involved in those actions. As long as the National Census and all federal, state, and other government agencies’ compilations of data on an individual continue to exist, they should be conducted only with the consent of the individual about whom the data are sought.

We oppose the mandatory issuance by the government of an identity card to be required for any purpose, such as for employment or border crossings. We support the right of individuals to use encryption and we oppose restrictions on its use or export.

### 3.A.3. Freedom of Speech
Freedom of speech and communication is essential to a free society. Any attempt by government to control communications, whatever the medium, is an attack on freedom of speech. We oppose any attempt by government to regulate film, recording, the Internet, other electronic media, or publishing industries, including the press. We oppose all forms of censorship, including the laws and regulations on adult-oriented materials, broadcast programming and content, and advertising. We propose that ownership of broadcast rights be based on the principle of property rights rather than license regulations. We advocate that the cable communications industry be free from government regulation or ownership.

### 3.A.4. Freedom of Expression
We defend the right of individuals to use their own property to express their own beliefs, no matter how repugnant to others; but not to infringe upon the property of others in that expression.

### 3.A.5. Freedom of Religion
We defend the rights of individuals to engage in or abstain from any religious activities that do not violate the rights of others. In order to defend religious freedom, we advocate a strict separation of church and state. We oppose government actions that either aid or attack any religion. We oppose taxation of church property for the same reason that we oppose all taxation.

### 3.A.6. Abortion and Population
We oppose government actions that compel, prohibit, regulate, or subsidize abortion, sterilization or any other forms of birth control. We oppose all coercive measures for population control.

We oppose government laws and policies that restrict the opportunity to choose alternatives to abortion, such as free market oriented adoption services.

We advocate replacing taxpayer subsidies for childbearing, such as AFDC, with private charity. We urge the elimination of special tax burdens on single people with few or no children.

### 3.A.7. “Victimless Crime”
We hold that any action that does not infringe upon the rights of others cannot properly be termed a crime, therefore we favor the repeal of all federal, state and local laws creating “crimes” without victims.

In particular we are opposed to all regulation of activities such as gambling, prostitution, juvenile “status offenses,” use or possession of medicines, drugs, drug paraphernalia, vitamins and firearms, and mandatory usage of seat belts and helmets.

We call for the repeal of all laws regarding consensual sexual acts, recognizing that minors are unable to consent to adults. The state has no right to proscribe any lifestyle that is freely chosen.

We call for an end to the “War on Drugs,” which is in reality a war by the federal, state and local government on the people. Until such time as the prohibition of drugs is repealed, we call for an end to the denial of pain relieving drugs such as marijuana and heroin to those who are suffering.

### 3.A.8. Children’s and Dependents’ Rights
Children and others who are dependent have the same right to be free of coercion as all other people. We accordingly call for the repeal of all juvenile status offenses such as truancy, under age smoking, curfews, etc.

We support the efforts of parents or guardians to protect their dependents from force or fraud.

Parents, or other guardians, have the right to raise their children according to their own standards and beliefs, provided that the rights of children to be free from abuse and neglect are also protected.

### 3.A.9. Government and “Mental Health”
We support the right of people to the control of their own minds. The involuntary commitment of an individual not convicted of a crime, but merely asserted to be different or incompetent, is a violation of liberty. We further advocate:

1. the repeal of all laws permitting involuntary psychiatric treatment of any persons, including those incarcerated in prisons or mental institutions;
2. an end to the spending of tax money for any program of psychiatric or psychological research or treatment;
3. an end to all involuntary treatment of prisoners in such areas as psycho-surgery, drug therapy, and aversion therapy;
4. an end to tax supported “mental health” propaganda campaigns and community “mental health” centers and programs.

### 3.A.10. Secession
We recognize the right to political secession. This includes the right of secession by political entities, private groups, or individuals.

### 3.A.11. The Right to Keep and Bear Arms
In recognition of the fact that individuals are their own last source of self-defense, and the fact that arms are property, we support the right of individuals to keep and bear arms. We oppose compulsory arms registration and regulation.

Minnesota is one of only seven states whose Constitution does not contain the right of individuals to keep and bear arms. We call for an amendment guaranteeing this right.

### 3.A.12. Due Process for the Criminally Accused
We defend the premise of “innocent until proven guilty,” therefore we oppose current “no knock” laws, preventative detention, and all similar measures which destroy liberty.

We also call for a repeal and elimination of all laws, rules, regulations and interpretations thereof as well as civil actions by the government which deprive individuals of their property (asset forfeiture) without being found guilty of any crime.

### 3.A.13. Restitution for the Falsely Accused
We support full restitution for all losses suffered by persons arrested, indicted, imprisoned, tried or otherwise injured in the course of criminal proceedings against them that do not result in their conviction or which is later overturned. Funding of restitution will be the responsibility of those persons initiating criminal action against the falsely accused if it can be proven the action was intentionally false.

Because life cannot be restored to a person who is wrongly executed, we oppose the death penalty in all cases.

### 3.A.14. Restitution for Victims of Crimes
We support restitution for the victim to the fullest degree possible at the expense of the criminal or wrongdoer. We accordingly oppose “no fault” insurance laws, which deprive the victim of the right to recover damages from those responsible.

### 3.A.15. Restoration of Criminals’ Liberty
A criminal, having paid for the crime, should be accorded full restoration of liberty.

### 3.A.16. Juries
We advocate replacing mandatory jury duty with voluntary juries and private arbitration.

We support the Fully Informed Jury Amendment, which would require judges to inform juries of their traditional right to decide the rightness or wrongness of the law in the given case, as well as the guilt or innocence of a person relative to the law.

### 3.A.17. Freedom of Association
We support the right of individuals to peacefully assemble for any purpose. Private associations and establishments should be free from government interference on questions of association and disassociation.

### 3.A.18. Equal Protection Under the Law
No individual’s freedom should be denied or abridged by the laws of the State of Minnesota or any locality. Protective labor laws and other laws which violate rights selectively should be repealed entirely rather than be extended to all groups.

### 3.A.19. Native American Indians and the State
We deplore the Federal and State governments’ continued paternalistic and exploitative policies toward the Native American. We call for the abolition of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which throughout its history has sought forcibly to make Native Americans wards of the State by destroying their individuality and traditional culture. We call for an end to Federal, State, and local interference in the property rights and civil liberties of Native Americans. We call on the State and Federal governments to honor all current treaty obligations.

### 3.A.20. Nullification and Subsidiarity
We recognize the important role of state legislatures and local units of government, as long as they exist, to declare null and void any federal law which infringes upon the rights of the individual. We recognize the obligation of law enforcement officials and courts, in particular county sheriffs and district attorneys, to refuse enforcement of and conviction under any rights-violating legislation or regulation.
