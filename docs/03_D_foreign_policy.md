## 3.D. Foreign Policy

### 3.D.1. Non-Intervention
The principle of non-initiation of force should guide the relationships between governments. We call for a non-interventionist foreign policy of avoiding entangling alliances, quarrels and treaties, and recognizing the right to unrestricted travel, trade and immigration. We advocate the negotiated withdrawal from current treaties that bind us to military commitments around the world. We favor the rapid resolution of all boundary disputes based on the existing treaty law. As fishing rights disputes are the most pressing of these questions, we propose these to be resolved first.

### 3.D.2. Veterans Affairs
We call on the U.S. Government to uphold its commitment to veterans by privatizing healthcare, by compensating veterans for physical and mental injuries incurred, and by ending continuous foreign military actions which have led to veterans becoming disabled.

### 3.D.3. Specific Planks
Specific planks on foreign policy can be found in the National Party platform.
