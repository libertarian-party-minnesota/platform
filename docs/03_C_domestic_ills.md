## 3.C. Domestic Ills
Current problems in such areas as crime, pollution, health care, decaying cities, and poverty are not solved, but are primarily caused, by government. The welfare state, supposedly designed to aid the poor, is in reality a growing and parasitic burden on all productive people, and on balance, injures rather than benefits the poor themselves.

“Public good” is the mask behind which various bureaucracies or pressure groups hide while using the government police powers to their own ends. We oppose any government action, acquisition of property, or violation of freedom in the name of the “public good.”

### 3.C.1. Land Use
The role of planning is properly the responsibility and right of the owners of the land. Accordingly we oppose all government intervention against this right such as zoning laws, building codes, urban renewal, regional planning, subdivision laws, rent controls, and eminent domain. We advocate free market methods of land use control by means of private land use covenants. We call for the repeal of laws which allow the state and local governments legally to steal private property through eminent domain or condemnation proceedings, regardless of “compensation.”

### 3.C.2. Pollution
Pollution of other people’s property is wrong. Strict liability, not government agencies and arbitrary standards, should regulate pollution. We advocate repeal of the laws that prevent full ownership of the air and water above and below land, thus denying individuals protection under the law against polluters. Private property rights must replace public property.

We further advocate repeal of corporate limited liability laws protecting the individuals who own or manage corporations from the personal liability of pollution.

We further advocate the repeal of sovereign immunity laws, which protect those in charge of government property, utilities and military installations from the personal liability of pollution.

### 3.C.3. Public Entertainment Facilities
We advocate a free market in entertainment; accordingly we call for the privatization and deregulation of all government ownership, financing or involvement in stadiums, fairs, malls, convention centers, racetracks, etc.

### 3.C.4. Education
In order to achieve the best possible opportunity of education we advocate bringing the positive benefits of competition to the monopolistic government schools. Therefore we call for the privatization and deregulation of schools. Also we call for the repeal of compulsory education laws, truancy laws, school and teacher certification and licensing laws, and taxpayer financing of education.

### 3.C.5. Campaign Laws
We call for the repeal of restrictive state laws that effectively prevent new parties and independent candidates from being on the ballot. We urge the repeal of federal and state campaign finance laws, which repress the voluntary support of candidates and parties, compel taxpayers to subsidize politicians and political views they do not wish to support, and entrench the two major political parties.

### 3.C.6. “Sunset Laws”
We advocate a constitutional amendment requiring an automatic end to all government offices, departments, bureaucracies, laws, regulations, and expenditures every year. And unless individually voted on they would cease to exist as such.

### 3.C.7. Sovereign Immunity
We call for an immediate end to the doctrine of “sovereign immunity,” which implies that the state can do no wrong and which holds that the state may not be held accountable without its permission.

### 3.C.8. None of the Above
We propose the addition of the alternative “none of the above is acceptable” to all ballots. In the event that “none of the above” wins, the elective office for that term will remain unfilled and unfunded.

### 3.C.9. Citizens Initiative and Referendum
We support a constitutional amendment recognizing the people’s right to Initiative and Referendum.

### 3.C.10. Government Accounting Practices
We support requiring government to follow generally accepted accounting principles and require the elimination of off-budget items.

### 3.C.11. Rotation of Legislative Committee Chairs
We support requiring the rotation of committee chairpersons and limiting their chairship to four years.
